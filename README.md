# devcontainer

Development container focused on Python (with first-class R support) providing a reproducible, batteries‚Äëincluded environment. It ships with the VS Code Dev Containers extension assets, curated tooling, and a consistent tagging strategy for deterministic rebuilds.

[![Build and Publish Dev Container](https://github.com/smartdatafoundry/devcontainer/actions/workflows/build-devcontainer.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/smartdatafoundry/devcontainer/actions/workflows/build-devcontainer.yml)

## üì¶ Published Container

Built and published automatically to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR):

* **Registry**: `ghcr.io`
* **Image**: `ghcr.io/smartdatafoundry/devcontainer`
* **Tag Families**:
  * `latest` ‚Äì Most recent stable main build
  * `main` ‚Äì Moving pointer to HEAD of main
  * `main-<branch-sha>` ‚Äì Immutable build for a specific main commit
  * `pr-<number>` ‚Äì Ephemeral preview for a pull request
  * `vscode-<vscode-sha>` ‚Äì Locks VS Code Server version (container content may still move)
  * `vscode-<vscode-sha>-<branch-sha>` ‚Äì Fully reproducible (VS Code Server + container commit)

Recommended:
* Daily development: `latest`
* CI / Reproducibility: `vscode-<vscode-sha>-<branch-sha>`
* VS Code Server pin only: `vscode-<vscode-sha>`

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Using the Published Container

Add this to your `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Python Development",
  "image": "ghcr.io/smartdatafoundry/devcontainer:latest"
}
```

### Using in SDF Trusted Research Environment

See the **[SDF TRE Setup Guide](SDF_TRE_SETUP.md)** for:
* Manual Dev Containers extension install & extraction
* Podman configuration
* Proxy / network specifics
* Troubleshooting in constrained environments

### Using This Repository Directly

1. Clone this repository
2. Open in VS Code
3. Select "Reopen in Container" when prompted

| Reusable publish workflow | `docs/BUILD_PUBLISH_CONTAINER.md` |
| Dev Container Specification | https://containers.dev |

## üõ†Ô∏è What's Included

- **Base**: Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble) via Microsoft's devcontainers base image
- **Python**: System Python with development tools (via devcontainer feature)
- **R**: Full R language support with development tools (via Rocker Project devcontainer feature)
- **Git**: Latest version with configuration support
- **Shell**: Zsh with Oh My Zsh (via common-utils feature)
- **Quarto**: Document publishing platform (latest version)

  - Black (Python formatting)
  - Jupyter
  - Marimo
  - Markdown All in One
  - Rainbow CSV
  - (See `.devcontainer/vscode-init/extensions-to-install.txt` for authoritative list)
- **VS Code Server**: Pre-installed for immediate development

## üìä R Language Support

This dev container includes comprehensive R language support through the [Rocker Project's devcontainer features](https://github.com/rocker-org/devcontainer-features). The R feature provides:

### Features Available
- **R Installation**: Latest R version via apt package manager
- **Development Tools**: devtools, renv for package management
- **IDE Integration**: 
  - languageserver package for VS Code R extension support
  - httpgd package for interactive graphics
  - rmarkdown for document generation
- **Jupyter Integration**: R kernel for Jupyter notebooks
- **Interactive Console**: radian (enhanced R console with syntax highlighting)
- **Debugging Support**: vscDebugger package for VS Code R debugging

## ‚öôÔ∏è VS Code Server

Pre-installed. Pin a version using the tag families described above or via build arg `VSCODE_COMMIT`. For environment-specific considerations (e.g. TRE) see `SDF_TRE_SETUP.md`.

## Adding New Extensions
To add new VS Code extensions to the container, follow these steps:
1. Open the appropriate file in `.devcontainer/vscode-init/`:
   - `extensions-to-install.txt` for extensions to install directly
   - `extensions-to-download.txt` for extensions that need to be downloaded
2. Add the identifier of the desired extension in the format `publisher.extensionName` on a new line.
3. Save the changes to the extension file.
4. Commit and push the changes to your repository to trigger the build workflow with the updated extensions

## üîÑ Automated Builds & Tag Strategy

Workflow: `.github/workflows/build-devcontainer.yml`

Triggers:
* Pull Requests touching devcontainer/workflow files ‚Üí build + `pr-<number>` tag
* Manual dispatch (with required `vscode_commit` input) ‚Üí publish full tag set

Outputs per production run:
* `latest`, `main`, `main-<branch-sha>`
* `vscode-<vscode-sha>`, `vscode-<vscode-sha>-<branch-sha>`

Manual build steps:
1. Open Actions ‚Üí Build and Publish Dev Container
2. Run workflow, supplying VS Code Server commit hash
3. Await completion & verify tags on GHCR package page

Tag usage quick reference:
| Need | Tag |
|------|-----|
| Stable rolling | `latest` |
| Immutable main snapshot | `main-<sha>` |
| Test PR | `pr-<number>` |
| Pin VS Code Server only | `vscode-<vscode-sha>` |
| Full reproducibility | `vscode-<vscode-sha>-<sha>` |

Reusable generic Docker workflow documentation: see `docs/BUILD_PUBLISH_CONTAINER.md`.
