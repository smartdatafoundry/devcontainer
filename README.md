# devcontainer

Container to support Python development that comes with baked in support for the Visual Studio Code Dev Container extension, additionally includes supporting tooling and a rich set of IDE extensions.

[![Build and Publish Dev Container](https://github.com/smartdatafoundry/devcontainer/actions/workflows/build-devcontainer.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/smartdatafoundry/devcontainer/actions/workflows/build-devcontainer.yml)

## üì¶ Published Container

This dev container is automatically built and published to GitHub Container Registry with multiple tags:

- **Registry**: GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)  
- **Base Image**: `ghcr.io/smartdatafoundry/devcontainer`
- **Available Tags**:
  - `latest` - Latest stable build from main branch
  - `main` - Latest build from main branch  
  - `main-<commit-sha>` - Specific commit builds from main branch
  - `pr-<number>` - Pull request builds for testing
  - `vscode-<vscode-commit-sha>` - Builds with specific VS Code versions
  - `vscode-<vscode-commit-sha>-<commit-sha>` - Combination of VS Code and git commit

**Recommended**: Use `latest` for stable deployments or `main-<commit-sha>` for reproducible builds.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Using the Published Container

Add this to your `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Python Development",
  "image": "ghcr.io/smartdatafoundry/devcontainer:latest"
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è VS Code Server

The container comes with VS Code Server pre-installed for immediate development. For TRE-specific VS Code Server configuration, see the [SDF TRE Setup Guide](SDF_TRE_SETUP.md).

## Adding New Extensions
To add new VS Code extensions to the container, follow these steps:
1. Open the `.devcontainer/vscode-init/vscode-extensions.txt` file.
2. Add the identifier of the desired extension in the format `publisher.extensionName` on a new line.
3. Save the changes to the `vscode-extensions.txt` file.
4. Commit and push the changes to your repository to trigger the build workflow with the updated extensions

## üîÑ Automated Builds

The container is built automatically with smart tagging:

- **Main Branch Pushes**: Creates `latest`, `main`, and `main-<commit-sha>` tags
- **Pull Requests**: Creates `pr-<number>` tags for testing
- **VS Code Commits**: Creates `vscode-<vscode-commit-sha>` and `vscode-<vscode-commit-sha>-<commit-sha>` tags
- **Manual Dispatch**: Available for on-demand builds
- **Platform**: linux/amd64 optimized for development speed

### Tag Strategy
- Use `latest` for the most recent stable release
- Use `main-<commit-sha>` when you need reproducible builds
- Use `pr-<number>` tags to test specific pull request changes
- Use `vscode-<commit-sha>` tags to match specific VS Code versions
- Use `vscode-<commit-sha>-<container-commit-sha>` tags for a combination of VS Code and git commits
